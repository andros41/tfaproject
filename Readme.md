## This is the readme for my TFA project group 29

### What we have done:
This project contain two notebooks analyzing non-emergency service calls to 311 in New York City:

1. Top10.ipynb
Finds the top 10 causes of calls to 311 in ZIP code 10027, and calculates how many total incidents of each of these 10 types there have been in the year 2020.

2. Parking.ipynb
Analyzes whether illegal parking incidents are a larger fraction of total 311 incidents in ZIP code 10027 than they are in general.
